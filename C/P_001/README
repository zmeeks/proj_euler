Problem statement:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23.  
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

programming language used here: C

Note: The first two methods to solve this that come to mind are using a hash table or array to 
keep from double counting.  Since n=1000 is so small, the space-complexity isn't a concern

type 'make' followed by 'make run' to run code
