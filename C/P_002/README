Problem statement:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

programming language used here: C

Note: The first two methods to solve this that come to mind are using an array of Fibonacci numbers or just a few recent terms.  The first way seems incredibly inefficient on account of the fact that there is an obvious pattern (even + odd = odd, odd + odd = even, etc).  

type 'make' followed by 'make run' to run code
