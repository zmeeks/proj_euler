Problem statement:
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10 001st prime number?

programming language used here: C++

Note: My solution makes use of the fact that we only need to check odd numbers against the primes.

type 'make' followed by 'make run' to run code
